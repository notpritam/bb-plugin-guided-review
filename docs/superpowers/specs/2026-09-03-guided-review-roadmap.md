# Guided Review → marketplace-grade: roadmap

Date: 2026-09-03
Status: capturing scope; Phase 1 in progress

This plugin is being published to the BB marketplace. Everything below is what
we're building toward, grouped so each phase ships something coherent, tested,
and reviewable rather than a scattershot mega-change.

## Phase 1 — Panel UX & screen utilization  (IN PROGRESS)

- **Landing/list redesign** — modern, card-based grid (not full-width rows),
  gradients + tasteful icons, kind/status badges, author + relative time, a
  prominent "Resume last review", and a real empty state. *(subagent in flight)*
- **Loading states → skeleton shimmer** — replace the "Building the guide…" text
  and the list's blank load with animated skeletons; icon-rich, reduced-motion
  aware, split into their own component. *(subagent building the primitive)*
- **Persistence across tab switches** — remember the last review, current chapter,
  scroll position, sidebar width, focus mode, and the agent dock/messages.
  *(`lib/panel-state.ts` written; wiring pending)*
- **Resizable sections** — drag-divider between sidebar and diff (persisted,
  collapsible to a rail); resizable/collapsible draft tray. Use all the width.
- **Focus mode + true full screen** — a Focus toggle that compresses chrome
  (header→slim, banners tucked, tray minimized, overview clamped) AND a separate
  button that calls the Fullscreen API on the panel root. *(user chose both)*
- **GitHub-style line selection** — pierre `enableLineSelection` + gutter "+"
  (`enableGutterUtility`/`onGutterUtilityClick`), controlled `selectedLines`
  highlight; a selection action bar → **Add comment** (inline composer via
  `renderAnnotation`, saved to the existing draft) or **Ask agent** (inject
  `{file, startLine, endLine, code}` into the dock).

## Phase 2 — Reviewer-agent intelligence

> Open question resolved by the "reviewer agent" clarifier below.

- **Persona / custom prompt** — a user-defined persona + extra instructions
  applied when the reviewer agent runs; stored in plugin storage, editable.
- **Self-learning loop** — capture each review comment the user writes together
  with the code it targets; periodically distill those into concrete
  improvements to the reviewer agent's prompt/rules, surfaced for the user to
  approve before they take effect.
- **Reviewer-agent dashboard** — a panel section to view/edit the agent's
  persona, prompt, and rules; a changelog of what changed, when, and why; and
  per-feature toggles.
- **Scheduled self-improvement** — an opt-in bb automation (daily/weekly) that
  runs the distillation; plus a lightweight check when the agent runs in a new
  thread that pulls the latest improved prompt. Fully toggleable.

## Phase 3 — Marketplace readiness & QA

- **Code/correctness review agent** pass over the whole extension; fix findings.
- **UX review agent** pass over every screen; fix findings.
- **Clean commit/PR flow** — reshape the branch into coherent commits, open a PR
  with a guided-review of itself.
- **Versioning & updates** — bump the version; a CHANGELOG; an in-app "what's
  new"/updates surface; feature toggles in settings.
- **GitHub release** — tag `vX.Y.Z` with release notes; confirm the
  `bb-marketplace` catalog range picks it up.

## Decided — "the reviewer agent" == the guide generator

The persona + rules shape how the **guide generator** authors chapters, risk
flags, and overviews. The self-learning loop improves that *generation* prompt
from the user's review comments. No separate critique/findings agent; the
floating Q&A dock keeps its own lightweight prompt. The Phase-2 dashboard edits
the generator's persona/rules and shows their change history.
