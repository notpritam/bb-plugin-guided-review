# Guided Review

An agent-authored walkthrough of a GitHub pull request or local Git change, inside [BB](https://getbb.app). Read the change in chapters, inspect the diff, ask questions, and prepare your review in one workspace.

**v0.2.0.** Each reviewer uses their own BB installation and GitHub identity. On a shared BB server, credentials, settings, and saved reviews are shared.

## Install and first run

You need **BB 0.41+ with Node 24+**, a configured BB agent provider, and `git` and GitHub CLI (`gh`) on the **machine running BB**. GitHub features support github.com. Installation uses prebuilt bundles; no npm or build step is needed.

Add the marketplace once, then install Guided Review:

```sh
bb marketplace add git:github.com/notpritam/bb-marketplace@main
bb marketplace refresh notpritam
bb plugin install guided-review@notpritam
```

Or open **Extensions**, search **Guided Review**, and choose **Install** after adding the marketplace. Direct Git installation can also follow compatible releases:

```sh
bb plugin install git:github.com/notpritam/bb-plugin-guided-review@^0.2.0
```

1. Open **Guided Review**. An empty workspace shows setup readiness; you can revisit it in **Settings → Ready to review**.
2. Sign in on the BB server with `gh auth login --hostname github.com`. Check the account displayed in Guided Review and its access to the repository. No token is pasted into the plugin.
3. Paste a GitHub PR link and choose **Review**. Your BB agent writes the chaptered guide using its normal usage allowance.
4. Read the chapters and diffs. Add draft comments, keep private reviewer notes, or ask the assistant about a file or selection.
5. Choose a verdict and **Submit to GitHub**. Drafting and generating never submit a review. Replies and resolve actions on existing GitHub threads are separate, immediate actions.

GitHub account switching affects `gh` on the BB server. Environment tokens can override saved-account selection; the plugin reports when a switch has not taken effect. Review submissions verify the displayed account and use its credential for the entire request.

## Updates

Open **Settings → Plugin updates** to check for a compatible release, read its release notes, and choose **Update now**. Save or discard settings edits and close other Guided Review pages first. BB installs the latest compatible release available at installation time; it may advance beyond the version shown by an earlier check.

**Automatic updates are off by default.** If enabled, the plugin checks hourly after five idle minutes and waits until all Guided Review and Settings pages are closed, with no generation, assistant, save, or submission in progress. Reviews, drafts, private notes, conversations, and preferences remain in BB. Failed checks are visible and retried later; BB handles failed-install rollback.

Marketplace installs track `^0.2.0` (compatible 0.2.x releases). Catalog refresh only refreshes listings. You can also update with `bb plugin update guided-review`; close the plugin’s pages first, since BB’s external update command does not use the in-plugin activity guard. Local directories and exact tags are pinned and do not receive automatic updates. To migrate a pinned installation, use BB’s source/install controls without removing plugin data.

An interrupted browser connection can leave an editing session protected. If the updater still asks you to close pages after they are all closed, save any work elsewhere and reload the plugin through BB. Editing sessions intentionally never expire while a laptop might still hold unsaved text.

## Local changes and the command line

Run commands from a project checkout available on the BB server:

```sh
bb review https://github.com/acme/web/pull/42
bb review 42                           # PR in the current repository
bb review origin/main...HEAD           # local range
bb review my-feature --base main       # branch against main
```

The checkout for a local review must exist on the BB server. A checkout only present on another enrolled machine is not supported by this release. Local reviews retain notes in BB and do not offer GitHub submission.

## What the review workspace includes

- Ordered chapters with intent, file summaries, and risk labels. Every changed file must appear once in the generated guide.
- Syntax-highlighted diffs, viewed-file tracking, a resizable chapter sidebar, and a collapsible chapter list on narrow screens.
- An Ask agent tool alongside drafts and reviewer notes. Pop out the assistant as a movable, resizable widget and Dock it again without losing your question or an answer in progress.
- CI status, existing GitHub review threads, and re-review when new commits arrive.
- A collapsible review sidebar with icons for draft comments, private notes, and Ask agent. Click an icon to open its tool; click it again or use the close control to collapse to the icon rail. The rail includes tooltips and a draft-count badge. The selected tool and open state survive reload; editors stay mounted while collapsed. On narrow screens the rail sits above the panel below the diff.
- Visible Approve, Comment, and Request changes buttons, followed by explicit submission and visible save or submission errors.

A review is pinned to the PR snapshot it was generated from. If the PR changes, re-review before submitting. Remove affected inline comments from an older patch, then add any replacements against the current patch. Submission failures retain the draft; repeated clicks cannot submit the same draft concurrently. Unsaved summaries and comments keep a recovery copy in this browser tab, bound to their original review revision. Re-review retains the previous view while its replacement is generated.

## Customize your reviews

Open **Settings** from the review list or workspace, or use Guided Review’s section in BB’s plugin settings. Choose Concise, Standard, or Detailed guides, add guide-writing instructions, customize the review assistant’s priorities, and select a default diff layout. Save settings to apply them across this installation. Restore defaults stages a change for you to save; it does not change settings immediately.

Guide instructions extend the bundled `guided-review-generate` skill. They apply to new guides and Re-review; the output schema and complete file coverage remain validated. Assistant instructions are read for every message, including existing conversations. Agent/provider selection follows the BB project configuration.

**Draft comments** contains line feedback and the **Review summary** that will go to GitHub when you submit. Select a comment’s file to jump back into the diff, or edit/remove it before sending. **Reviewer notes** is a separate scratchpad: it is saved in BB and never included in GitHub submissions or assistant prompts. Notes survive submission and archival. If saving fails, unsaved notes have a browser recovery copy; conflicting edits can be compared with the saved version before choosing what to keep. Existing review summaries retain their original public-draft meaning.

## Data and access

Review metadata, patches, generated guides, and drafts are stored in this BB installation’s plugin database. Review agents receive the patch and context through your configured BB provider; that provider’s data handling applies. This plugin does not add a separate hosted review service.

GitHub operations use the server’s `gh` credentials. No token needs to be pasted into the plugin. Grant only the repository access your team needs. A shared BB server uses shared server credentials and plugin storage; it is not a multi-tenant review service.

Older saved reviews remain available. New reviews use repository-scoped identifiers, preventing equal PR numbers in different repositories from overwriting each other. Legacy inline drafts must be removed and re-added against the current patch before submission.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
bb plugin types
npm run check
bb plugin install .
bb plugin dev
```

Development checks use the SDK test harness, temporary Git repositories, and mocked GitHub writes. Use a Node.js version compatible with the installed `better-sqlite3` package (this release was verified on Node.js 24).

Build and commit `dist/` before tagging a release. Keep published tags immutable. Read [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release changes.

Inspired by [plannotator/guides](https://github.com/plannotator/guides). The viewer and generation workflow here run through BB.

## Review state and archive

Review-agent conversations stay in Guided Review. Existing mapped worker threads are hidden on startup, and idle runtimes are released after each answer. If a worker has been archived or deleted, the next question starts a fresh hidden worker with the prior conversation as context. Archived PRs can still be discussed: cleanup waits for the answer before archiving that temporary worker. Approved, commented, and changes-requested reviews appear under Reviewed. A new commit returns a submitted review to Needs review while retaining its earlier verdict. Merged and closed PRs move to Archive automatically; their guides, conversations, and unsent drafts remain accessible. GitHub is checked every minute and through Refresh. A failed GitHub read preserves saved state.

## Browser regression test

Use Node 24, matching the installed SQLite native module. Build and reload this plugin in an isolated test BB, then run:

```sh
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
bb plugin build
BB_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4331 bb plugin reload guided-review
BB_E2E_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4331 npm test -- --project e2e
```

The browser uses the running BB shell and built plugin UI. Guided Review RPC requests are intercepted into the official SDK test host with real temporary SQLite. GitHub and agent calls are stubbed at their external boundaries, so no real PR review or agent thread is created. The flow covers settings persistence, draft-comment editing, public summaries, private-note isolation, fullscreen verdict buttons, submission, reload, plugin-only chat with file context, sidebar collapse/persistence, keyboard tooltips, panel/widget draft preservation, archived-worker replacement, merge archival, and desktop/390px mobile layouts. Without `BB_E2E_URL`, this test is skipped.
